Q1:If the user input is "4.5" what is the output?
import math
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
num = num**num+1
num = math.sqrt(num)
print(int(num))

Cl1:Python has the in-built function input that takes the input from a user
Cl2:Casting a number to an int will truncate the decimal of a float
Cl3:A standard module in Python is math
Cl4:Using the math module you can take a square root of a number

A:16
W1:20.25
W2:17
W3:32

Q2:What will the output of the code be below?
str = "Hello World"
myset = set(str)
str[0] = "M"
myset = set(str)
print(myset)

Cl1:A list in Python is an ordered sequence of elements that is mutable
Cl2:A set in Python is a mutable collection of data types with no duplicates
Cl3:A tuple is a collection that is ordered and immutable
Cl4:A string in Python is immutable, but you could re-assign the variable

A:TypeErrorL 'str' object does not support item assignment
W1:{'W', 'r', 'l', 'H', 'e', ' ', 'd', 'o'}
W2:{'W', 'r', 'l', 'H', 'e', 'd', 'o'}
W3:WrlHedo

Q3:What is the output of the code below?
for x in range(10):
	if(x == 10):
		break
	if(x%2 == 0):
		print("Hi ", end="")
		pass
	if(x%3 == 1):
		print("Bye ", end="")
		continue
		break

Cl1:The range function returns a sequence of numbers starting from 0
Cl2:In Python pass is a null statement, which results in no operation
Cl3:The continue statement in Python returns to the beginning of a loop
Cl4:A break statement works just like the tradition break in C

A:Hi Bye Hi Hi Bye Hi Bye Hi
W1:Hi Bye Hi Bye Hi Bye Hi Hi 
W2:Hi Hi Bye Hi Hi Bye Hi Bye OH
W3:Hi Bye Hi Hi Bye Hi Bye Hi OH

Q4:What happens to the instance a in memory?
class aClass(object):
	pass
a = aClass
a.obj = a
del a

Cl1:Memory is managed by Python in a private heap space
Cl2:Python objects and data structures are located in a private heap
Cl3:Python has a built in garbage collector to free space in the heap
Cl4:When an object has no references it is removed from memory

A:The instance is deleted and the memory is then deleted by garbage collection
W1:Only the memory is deleted, but not the instance of the object
W2:A error occurs for manually trying to delete the instance
W3:The instance is no longer accessible, but not deleted in memory


Q5:What is the output of the code below?
class Monkey:
	def __init__(self, see, do):
		self.see = see
		self.do = do
chimp = Monkey(True, True)
if(chimp.see):
	if(chimp.do):
		print("I'll make a fool out of you")
	else:
		print("I can't")
else:
	print("I am blind")

Cl1:A Class in Python is like an object constructor, or "blueprint" for objects
Cl2:You would use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties
Cl3:Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object
Cl4:self is a keyword that references the current instance of a class

A:I'll make a fool out of you
W1:I'm no monkey
W2:I can't
W3:I am blind
