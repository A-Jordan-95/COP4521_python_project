Team Members:

current ideas:
-2D graphics based game
    -python Arcade library seems to be a good choice for game design
    -gameplay ideas:
      -"Escape the Evil Hacker's Lair"
        -Mario style adventure game
        -cave setting
        -players collect pieces of a computer on each level(hard drive, monitor, keyboard, mouse etc)
        -avoid evil AI robots roaming around the caves.
        -once all pieces found can use the computer to open the "vault" or something similar to the next level.
        -maybe have player use computer to answer a computer sciencey question to "unlock" next level? 
          -i.e. what is proper syntax for python for loop, etc.
