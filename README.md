current ideas:
-2D graphics based game
    -python Arcade library seems to be a good choice for game design
    -gameplay ideas:
      -"Escape the Evil Hacker's Lair"
        -Mario style adventure game
        -cave setting
        -players collect pieces of a computer on each level(hard drive, monitor, keyboard, mouse etc)
        -avoid evil AI robots roaming around the caves.
        -once all pieces found can use the computer to open the "vault" or something similar to the next level.
        -maybe have player use computer to answer a computer sciencey question to "unlock" next level? 
          -i.e. what is proper syntax for python for loop, etc.
        -two possible styles of gameplay:
            -1. Mario 2d style with scrolling screen, players can jump and run left to right
                -cons:
                    -programming physics for jumping + screen scrolling may be fairly complicated
                -pros:
                    -the final product would be more entertaining/advanced and generally look better
            -2. Minesweeper-ish style 2d where the whole map is viewed from above not the side
                -cons:
                    -slightly less advanced/entertaining final product.
                -pros:
                    -don't have to program jump or screen scrolling physics, could still achieve
                        a gameplay that represents the original idea above w/ computer pieces to find
                        and robots to avoid. maybe the computer pieces are hidden under rocks but some rocks 
                        set off a switch that lets in more robots to avoid?
