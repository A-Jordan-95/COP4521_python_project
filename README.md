# Project Description:
  - This is a game written using python 3.6 or greater, which makes use of the arcade library,
    the sqlite3 library, as well as the passlib library.
  - The maps were built using the Tiled Map Editor software.
  - sprites in the game came from various open source resources including:
    - https://kenney.nl/
    - https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/maplestory -credit to Boo and Magekar for sprites
  - The purpose of the game is to collect all the python clues per level, then use those clues
    to answer a python related question in order to advance to the next level and escape the 
    evil Hacker's lair.
