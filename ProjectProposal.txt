Our project will be a 2D game with a graphical user interface which has an
escape theme. The setting will be in a cave and will require the player to find
hidden pieces of a computer in order to solve a quick question about <general
programming knowledge/python syntax specifically> in order to unlock the next
level. The player will also have to avoid robots that can kill them. The game
will be built using the arcade library framework. for the division of work,
< "enter division of work here" >
< Nick: Work on menus and transition screens, level design, and other gameplay elements>
